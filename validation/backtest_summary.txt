[OK] Good model accuracy (<25% error)
[OK] No significant systematic bias


DATA-DERIVED BASELINES USED (from 2024)
--------------------------------------------------
  Large Market        : Won/mo=3.49, Median=$205,320, WR=100.0%, DSO=122d
  Indirect            : Won/mo=24.65, Median=$1,701, WR=98.0%, DSO=4d
  Mid Market          : Won/mo=22.04, Median=$16,692, WR=99.1%, DSO=72d
  SMB                 : Won/mo=16.71, Median=$5,580, WR=98.7%, DSO=37d
  Other               : Won/mo=0.10, Median=$5,840, WR=100.0%, DSO=29d


BACKTEST ASSUMPTIONS (NEUTRAL)
------------------------------
  volume_growth_multiplier                : 1.0
  win_rate_uplift_multiplier              : 1.0
  deal_size_inflation                     : 1.0
  num_simulations                         : 500
  velocity_smoothing_window               : 3
  confidence_interval_clip                : 0.95


KEY CHANGES IN V5
-----------------
1. CLOSURE-BASED: Models deals WON per month directly (not creation + conversion)
2. PERCENTILE SIZING: Deal sizes sampled from median/IQR distribution
3. PIPELINE BOOST: Decaying addition for early months, not weighted blend
4. AGE-ADJUSTED WR: Older pipeline deals have reduced win probability

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
[OK] Model is suitable for production forecasting.
     Apply growth multipliers for 2026 projections.
