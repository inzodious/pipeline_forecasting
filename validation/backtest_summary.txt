[OK] Excellent model accuracy (<15% error)
[OK] No significant systematic bias


DATA-DERIVED BASELINES USED (from 2024)
--------------------------------------------------
  Large Market        : Won/mo=0.51, Median=$306,216, WR=17.2%, DSO=83d
  Mid Market          : Won/mo=2.53, Median=$107,152, WR=25.9%, DSO=57d
  Small Market        : Won/mo=3.28, Median=$27,178, WR=23.6%, DSO=44d


BACKTEST ASSUMPTIONS (NEUTRAL)
------------------------------
  volume_growth_multiplier                : 1.0
  win_rate_uplift_multiplier              : 1.0
  deal_size_inflation                     : 1.0
  num_simulations                         : 500
  velocity_smoothing_window               : 3
  confidence_interval_clip                : 0.95


KEY CHANGES IN V5
-----------------
1. CLOSURE-BASED: Models deals WON per month directly (not creation + conversion)
2. PERCENTILE SIZING: Deal sizes sampled from median/IQR distribution
3. PIPELINE BOOST: Decaying addition for early months, not weighted blend
4. AGE-ADJUSTED WR: Older pipeline deals have reduced win probability

RECOMMENDATION
--------------
[OK] Model is suitable for production forecasting.
     Apply growth multipliers for 2026 projections.
