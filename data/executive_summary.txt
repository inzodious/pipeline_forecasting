======================================================================

FORECAST OVERVIEW
-----------------
Expected Annual Revenue (P50):     $8,126,090
Conservative Case (P10):           $2,645,886
Optimistic Case (P90):             $16,282,795
Expected Deal Volume:              45 deals

Forecast Range Width:              $13,636,909 (167.8% of median)

CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
---------------------
The forecast indicates a 90% probability that 2026 revenue will fall between
$2,645,886 and $16,282,795, with the median expectation at 
$8,126,090.

Statistical constraints have been applied to ensure professional-grade forecast
reliability. This includes:
  • Win rate bounds: 5% - 50%
  • Monthly deal volume range: 3 - 100 per segment
  • Deal size variance cap: ±25%
  • Velocity smoothing: 3-month rolling average
  • Outlier clipping: 95% threshold

These constraints prevent unrealistic outliers and ensure the forecast remains
within business-viable parameters.

KEY DRIVERS
-----------
1. Volume Growth: 10% increase in qualified deal creation
2. Win Rate Improvement: 5% efficiency gain in deal conversion
3. Deal Size Inflation: 3% average contract value growth

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
-------------------
Global Market is projected to drive 58.6% of total revenue,
making it the primary growth driver for 2026.

Segment Breakdown:
  - Global Market       : $   4,825,744  ( 58.6%)
  - Large Market        : $   2,187,994  ( 26.6%)
  - Mid-Market          : $   1,004,318  ( 12.2%)
  - Small Market        : $     219,457  (  2.7%)


METHODOLOGY
-----------
This forecast was generated using 500 Monte Carlo 
simulations with monthly aggregation based on 2024-2025 historical performance.

The model incorporates:
  - Segment-specific win rates from mature deal cohorts only
  - Monthly velocity patterns with 3-month smoothing
  - Historical sales cycle lengths by market segment
  - Statistical constraints to prevent unrealistic variance
  - Outlier detection and removal (95% threshold)

STATISTICAL CONTROLS APPLIED
-----------------------------
To ensure forecast reliability, the following business constraints are enforced:

Win Rate Bounds:
  Minimum: 5.0%  |  Maximum: 50.0%
  Rationale: Prevents model from predicting impossibly low or high conversion rates

Monthly Volume Bounds (per segment):
  Minimum: 3 deals  |  Maximum: 100 deals
  Rationale: Ensures forecasts stay within operational capacity

Deal Size Variance:
  Maximum: ±25% from segment average
  Rationale: Prevents unrealistic mega-deals from skewing projections

These constraints can be adjusted in ASSUMPTIONS configuration based on
management's business judgment and operational constraints.

VALIDATION STATUS
-----------------
Model accuracy should be validated using the backtest_validator.py script,
which tests predictive performance against holdout historical data.

Expected backtest accuracy: MAPE < 20%, Bias < ±10%
